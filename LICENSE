      B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional 
         or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective

      construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use

      attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

      Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar 
      personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives 
      and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the

      from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or

      reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed 
      Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.

   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner 
      based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed

      providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required 
      information.

      required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, 
   reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of 
   the database for NonCommercial purposes only and provided You do not Share 
   Adapted Material;
   
b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a 
   database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in 
   which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) 
   is Adapted Material; and
   
c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a 
   substantial portion of the contents of the database.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, 
   THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO 
   REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, 
   WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY

   EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS 
   PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall 
   be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely 
   approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights 
   licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then 
   Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 
   6(a), it reinstates:
   
   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured 
      within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
      
   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the 
   Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material 
   under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material 
   at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or 
   conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed 
   Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and 
   conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be 
   interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of 
   the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under 
   this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed 
   unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent 
   necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it 
   shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability 
   of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to 
   comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a 
   limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the 
   Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or 
   authority.
